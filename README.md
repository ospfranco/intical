# Intical

A more visual representation of a calendar

## Usage
The thing is built on Next.js, the idea is for it to be embedable anywhere, but it might make more sense to port it to electron or something like that so it can read calendar data for the OS (if possible)

Only the concept of the UI is done for now, so it needs to connect to a OS API or a online API to retrieve appointment information, but no idea how to achieve this google calendar and iCal should be the first to be done
